# My AMA

Questions I get asked by awesome people :)

checkout them in the [Issues](https://github.com/horacioh/ama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc) on this repository.

also checkout this [resources list](./learning-resources.md) I compile with all the things I share with my students.

Happy Learning!
